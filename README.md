## Quickstart

1. Edit [CLAUDE.md](./ai/CLAUDE.md) with a clear, detailed description of what you want (goals, constraints, examples, and expected outputs).
2. Install an AI CLI:
   - Claude: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code
   - Codex: https://github.com/openai/codex
3. Make the script executable and run it:
   - `chmod +x ai/ai.sh`
   - `./ai/ai.sh`
4. Watch the terminal for progress and check generated files when it finishes.

## Tips

- Be explicit in ai/CLAUDE.md about file locations and desired edits.
- Keep small, focused requests for faster, more reliable results.
- Review changes before committing.
